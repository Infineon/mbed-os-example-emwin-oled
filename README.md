# PSoC6 MCU: emWin OLED with Mbed OS

This code example demonstrates how to display graphics on an OLED display using emWin graphics library in Mbed OS. The example uses the CY8CKIT-032 AFE Shield. This shield has a monochrome OLED display with the SSD1306 controller with a resolution of 128x64 pixels.

Tested with Mbed OS v6.2.1.

## Hardware Setup

This code example requires [CY8CKIT-032 PSoC Analog Front End (AFE) Arduino Shield](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-032-psoc-analog-front-end-afe-arduino-shield).

**Note:** The PSoC 6 BLE Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-BLE) and the PSoC 6 WiFi-BT Pioneer Kit (CY8CKIT-062-WIFI-BT) ship with KitProg2 installed. The ModusToolbox software requires KitProg3. Before using this code example, make sure that the board is upgraded to KitProg3. The tool and instructions are available in the [Firmware Loader](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/Firmware-loader) GitHub repository. If you do not upgrade, you will see an error like "unable to find CMSIS-DAP device" or "KitProg firmware is out of date".

For Mbed OS, the kit must be in DAPLink mode. See the **KitProg3 User Guide** (see *Documentation* tab in the [Cypress Programming Solutions](https://www.cypress.com/products/psoc-programming-solutions) web page) to learn how to put the Pioneer Kit into DAPLink mode.

## Software Setup

Install a terminal emulator if you don't have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

This example requires no additional software or tools.

## Import the Code Example Using Mbed CLI

Mbed CLI commands are used to import the code example and compile. See [Working with Mbed CLI web page](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.2/tools/working-with-mbed-cli.html).

```
mbed import https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-emwin-oled
```

This command first clones the code example repository from GitHub, and then deploys all the libraries.

If you wish to perform the *deploy* process manually, use the following commands:

1. Clone the GitHub code example repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/mbed-os-example-emwin-oled && cd mbed-os-example-emwin-oled
   ```

2. Deploy the dependent libraries. The library files are identified with the *.lib* extension.

   ```
   mbed deploy
   ```

3. Set the current directory as *root*:

   ```
   mbed new .
   ```

## Operation

If using a PSoC 64 Secure MCU kit (like CY8CKIT-064B0S2-4343W), the PSoC 64 Secure MCU must be provisioned with keys and policies before being programmed. Follow the instructions in the [Secure Boot SDK User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/software-and-drivers/psoc-64-secure-mcu-secure-boot-sdk-user-guide) to provision the device. If the kit is already provisioned, copy-paste the keys and policy folder to the application folder.

1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.

2. Program the board using the Mbed command to compile and flash the application using hte default toolchain to the default target:

      ```
      mbed compile -m <TARGET> -t <TOOLCHAIN> --flash --sterm
      ```

      For example, to build for the target `CY8CKIT-062-BLE` with the toolchain `GCC_ARM`, use the following command:

      ```
      mbed compile -m CY8CKIT_062_BLE -t GCC_ARM --flash --sterm
      ```

   **Note:** With the `--sterm` option, Mbed CLI opens a new terminal with 9600-8N1 as the setting after programming completes. Do not use this option if you want to connect using another serial terminal application such as PuTTY or Tera Term.

3. After programming, the application starts automatically. Confirm that the the startup screen with Cypress logo is displayed on the OLED display for 3 seconds. After 3 seconds, another screen with instructions to press the user switch to scroll through the display pages is displayed.

4. Press the user switch to scroll through various display pages that demonstrate the emWin graphic library's 2D graphics features:
  - Text wrap and rotation
  - Font sizes - normal fonts
  - Font sizes - bold fonts
  - Text alignments and styles
  - 2D Graphics with vertical lines of various thickness, rectangles and circles

## Debugging

You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **\<Application Name> Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For more details, see the "Program and Debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

Follow the steps from [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox User Guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide#page=23) to export the Mbed OS code example and import it into Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox for programming and debugging.

Mbed OS also supports debugging using any IDE that supports GDB. See [Arm Mbed documentation](https://os.mbed.com/docs/mbed-os/v6.2/debug-test/index.html) to learn about debugging steps.

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM4 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice - once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.


## Design and Implementation

This code example requires the [CY8CKIT-032 PSoC Analog Front End (AFE) Arduino Shield](https://www.cypress.com/documentation/development-kitsboards/cy8ckit-032-psoc-analog-front-end-afe-arduino-shield). It has a 128x64 graphics OLED display which can communicate through the I2C interface.

There are three important parts in this code example:

1. **emWin Graphics Library:** The emWin Graphics Library is implemented as a middleware and has all the graphics functions. In this example, the library manages a display buffer and updates it with the pixel data in accordance with the graphics operations performed.

   See the [emWin middleware documentation](https://github.com/cypresssemiconductorco/emwin) on GitHub learn about the structure of the emWin package, supported drivers, and for a quick start guide to create and run your first emWin project from scratch. The documentation page also contains configuration details on a wide variety of display drivers provided my emWin.

2. **OLED Display Driver:** The OLED display has a SSD1306 controller. The display-oled-ssd1306 library is used to drive the display. This library provides functions to support the dot matrix OLED display driven by the SSD1306 controller through the I2C interface.

3. **Application Code:** The application code calls emWin graphics APIs to perform graphic functions.
